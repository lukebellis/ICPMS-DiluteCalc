ICP-MS Dilution Calculator
==========================

The ICP-MS Dilution Calculator is a web application designed to assist chemists and laboratory technicians in calculating the necessary dilutions for samples analyzed by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). This tool simplifies the process of adjusting sample concentrations to fall within the optimal detection range of ICP-MS instruments, such as the Agilent 7000 Series.

Features
--------

-   Dilution Factor Calculation: Automatically calculates the dilution factor needed to bring a sample's concentration within the detection limit of the ICP-MS instrument.
-   Volume Calculation: Determines the exact volumes of analyte and solvent required to achieve the desired dilution, optimizing accuracy and efficiency in sample preparation.
-   Unit Conversion: Supports various concentration units (Âµg/L, mg/L, ng/L), allowing for flexible input according to user preference.

Formulas Used
-------------

The application uses the following formulas to calculate the dilution factor and the volumes of analyte and solvent needed:

1. **Dilution Factor (DF)**: 
   \[ DF = \frac{C_{\text{initial}}}{C_{\text{final}}} \]
   - \(C_{\text{initial}}\): Initial concentration of the sample.
   - \(C_{\text{final}}\): Desired final concentration (within the ICP-MS detection limit).

2. **Volume of Analyte to Use**: 
   \[ V_{\text{analyte}} = \frac{V_{\text{sample}}}{DF} \]
   - \(V_{\text{sample}}\): Total volume of the sample after dilution.
   - \(DF\): Dilution factor.

3. **Volume of Solvent to Add**: 
   \[ V_{\text{solvent}} = V_{\text{sample}} - V_{\text{analyte}} \]

These formulas ensure that users can accurately prepare their samples for analysis, achieving concentrations that fall within the instrument's optimal detection range.


Project Setup
-------------

To get started with the ICP-MS Dilution Calculator:

1.  Install Dependencies:

    bashCopy code

    `npm install`

2.  Run the Development Server:

    bashCopy code
